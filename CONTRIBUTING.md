# Contribution Guidelines
**Enhancements, bug reports, and site testing are welcomed and highly encouraged!**

*This guide serves to set clear expectations for everyone involved with the project so that we can improve it together while also creating a welcoming space for everyone to participate. Following these guidelines will help ensure a positive experience for contributors and maintainers.*

### ðŸª² Finding an Issue
We use GitHub issues associated with the project to track the work associated with that project. That's where you can find things to work on. Each issue is associated with a tag as follows:
- `good first issue` : Open to participation from the community and friendly towards new contributors
- `help wanted` : Open to participation from the community but not necessarily beginner-friendly
- `ðŸ”’ staff only` : Requires infrastructure access or institutional knowledge that would be impractical to provide to the community.

### ðŸ”­ Proposing a new issue or feature
If you want to work on something that there is no GitHub issue for, follow these steps:

- Create a new GitHub issue associated with the relevant repository and propose your change there. 
- Be sure to be as detailed as possible, include implementation details, relevant screenshots and the rationale for the proposed change.
- If proposing any new feature or enhancements, please add `[FEATURE]` or `[ENHANCEMENT]` tag before the title of the issue.
  For eg: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63c26a4f-6844-42fe-afb9-719656170e38)
Similar goes for enhancement.

**We are very reluctant to accept random pull requests without a related issue created first.**

### ðŸ“¥ Submitting Pull Requests
- Create an issue (if not already present)
    - If working on a new enhancement, feature or bug that is not already present in the issues section of the repository, please create one and discuss before making any changes.
- Describe Your Pull Request
  - Use the format specified in pull request template for the repository. Populate the stencil completely for maximum verbosity.
    - **Title** - should contain the issue number that this PR resolves. For eg: `[FIX: #<issue_number>] : summary of the changes`
    - **Description** - describe the changes in detail. Add any relevant screenshots supporting the changes (optional).
    - **Issue Number** - tag the actual issue number by replacing `#<issue_number>` e.g. `#42`. This closes the issue when your PR is merged.

  - Describe your change in detail. Too much detail is better than too little.
  - Describe how you tested your change.
  - Check the Preview tab to make sure the Markdown is correctly rendered and that all tags and references are linked. If not, go back and edit the Markdown.
